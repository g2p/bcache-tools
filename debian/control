Description: bcache userspace tools
 Bcache allows the use of SSDs to cache other block devices.
 .
 Documentation for the run time interface is included in the kernel tree, in
 Documentation/bcache.txt.
 .
 This package includes udev rules, initramfs support and the following tools:
 make-bcache
 Formats block devices for use with bcache.  Devices can be formatted for use
 as a cache or as a backing device.
 The most important option is for specifying the bucket size.
 Allocation is done in terms of buckets, and cache hits are counted per bucket;
 thus a smaller bucket size will give better cache utilization, but poorer write
 performance. The bucket size is intended to be equal to the size of your SSD's
 erase blocks, which seems to be 128k-512k for most SSDs; feel free to
 experiment.
 .
 bcache-super-show
 Prints the bcache superblock of a cache device or a backing device.
